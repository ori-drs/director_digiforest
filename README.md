# History

This repo (from Oxford Dynamic Robot Systems Group) is a fork of the original [Director master](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/director). Originally Director was developed as the primary user interface used by Team MIT in the DARPA Robotics Challenge.

This previous version was heavily integrated with Drake and did not use ROS. It continues to be developed as the user interface for Drake by Toyota Research Institute. [Link to RobotLocomotion/TRI's version of Director](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/director).

In addition to Atlas, its been used to operate ANYmal in Oxford Dynamic Robot Systems Group, [NASA's Valkyrie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSP8iZyhTE), a Clearpath Husky with [two RE2 arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t1c_lrEH1k) and another with [two UE5 arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OyAzHcDL5M).
